# Security Policy

## üîê Security Overview

This repository implements enterprise-grade security measures with comprehensive automated scanning and monitoring. We take security seriously and have implemented multiple layers of protection.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

#### Professional CodeQL Analysis
- **Multi-language scanning**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C/C++, C#, Go, Ruby
- **Advanced configuration**: Custom query suites and performance optimization
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Security vulnerabilities, code quality, maintainability
- **Scheduled scans**: Monday/Thursday mornings + Friday evening comprehensive analysis
- **Real-time analysis**: On every push and pull request

#### Dependency Security
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Daily automated scans with Safety and pip-audit
- **License compliance**: Automated license checking and reporting
- **Supply chain security**: Dependabot integration for automated updates
- **SARIF integration**: Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

#### Additional Security Tools
- **Bandit**: Python security linting for common security issues
- **Trivy**: Filesystem vulnerability scanning
- **ShellCheck**: Shell script security and quality analysis

### Security Configuration Files

- **`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`**: Professional CodeQL analysis workflow
- **`.github/codeql-config.yml`**: Advanced CodeQL configuration
- **`.github/workflows/dependency-scan.yml`**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **`.github/dependabot.yml`**: Automated dependency updates

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Reporting Process

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** report privately using one of these methods:
   - Email: [Contact the maintainer privately]
   - GitHub Security Advisories: Use the "Report a vulnerability" option in the Security tab
   - GitHub Security Lab: For CodeQL-related issues

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and severity assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 48 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 1 week for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have had time to update

## üéØ Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
2. **Follow secure coding practices**: Review security guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
3. **Test security changes**: Ensure security improvements don't break functionality
4. **Update dependencies**: Keep dependencies current and secure
5. **Review code thoroughly**: All PRs undergo security review

### For Users

1. **Keep repository updated**: Regularly pull latest security fixes
2. **Review security alerts**: Monitor GitHub Security tab for new findings
