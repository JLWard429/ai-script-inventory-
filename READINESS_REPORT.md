- [x] **Linting**: Black, isort, flake8 configured

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### 1. Natural Language Commands
The terminal understands natural language requests:
```
User: "Run the security scan on all Python files in shell_scripts"
→ Recognizes: RUN_SCRIPT intent with parameters (scope: all, file_type: python, directory: shell_scripts)

User: "Summarize the latest README"
→ Recognizes: SUMMARIZE intent with latest scope detection

User: "How do I use this system?"
→ Recognizes: AI_CHAT intent for conversational assistance
```

### 2. Privacy-First Design
- ✅ **Local-only processing**: No cloud dependencies
- ✅ **Offline functionality**: Works without internet connection
- ✅ **spaCy NLP**: Advanced language processing runs locally
- ✅ **No external API calls**: All AI features are local

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Script Management**: Execute and organize AI-related scripts
- **File Operations**: Intelligent file listing, searching, and summarization
- **Development Tools**: Integration with linting, testing, security scanning
- **Auto-organization**: Scripts automatically categorized by type
- **Contextual Help**: AI-powered assistance and guidance

## 🛠️ Development Environment
