Is submitting a Rule 12 internal review request to the GMC to challenge a previous decision regarding one or more doctors. They have uploaded the full GMC Rule 12 form and supporting guidance. User intends to argue material flaw and/or introduce new evidence.
	
Is preparing a formal response email to the General Medical Council (GMC) challenging the legitimacy, accuracy, and handling of their 17 July 2025 decision letter. Concerns include the dismissal of a 28 mm lymph node as non-significant, the lack of a named investigator, and the absence of prior communications. Supporting documents have been provided for forensic review and thorough cross-referencing of spelling, grammar, facts, and procedural consistency. Further material will be sent for inclusion.
	
Has requested a forensic examination and formal response draft addressed to the GMC Enquiries Team. The response will challenge the GMC's 17 July 2025 decision letter regarding Dr. Lopez, Dr. Chowdhury, and Dr. Suciu. It will cross-reference saved memory logs, confirm inconsistencies, and raise concerns about the handling and dismissal of key clinical evidence, especially the 28 mm lymph node. The response will exclude the complaint reference number, be addressed generally to the Enquiries Team, and include mention of audio recordings and supporting documentation to follow.
	
Clarified that Dr. Adela Suciu *did* have access to the full DICOM file when providing her opinion regarding the PET-CT scan. This corrects the previous assumption that she did not.
	
Confirms that a false claim regarding mental health being the reason for unfitness to work was included in their letter. They clarify that they are under private mental health care, with regular consultations and no current mental health concerns.
	
Is planning to build a custom Santos Double Travel Alloy Tandem (Rohloff-compatible) from a partially built frame. Key specs: Handmade alloy frame, disc brakes, eccentric bottom brackets, and specific captain/stoker tube sizes. User wants a complete parts list down to bolts and washers.
	
Would like to use basic, budget-friendly parts wherever possible for the Santos tandem bike build. High-end or premium options are not required unless necessary for compatibility or safety.
	
Is submitting a Rule 12 review request to the GMC in response to their decision dated 17 July 2025 regarding Dr. Tony Lopez, Dr. ViJoy Chowdhury, and Dr. Adela Suciu. User has gathered new evidence including the amended HL7 report from Mount Alvernia, confirmation that the PET-CT report was unverified, and documentation of a 27–28mm lymph node that was not clinically followed up. The Rule 12 submission will address omissions in the original GMC findings and request a formal internal review.
	
Has had a referral initiated to The Royal Marsden Hospital via NHS Right to Choose, specifically to the Haematology Service, as confirmed by Green Elms Jaywick GP practice. Dr. Campbell is currently on holiday and will review the referral upon return.
	
Has formally refused any further clinical involvement from Dr. Gavin Campbell due to his professional ties with Dr. ViJoy Chowdhury and his role as the original consultant involved in the disputed case from June/July 2024. All referrals or reviews involving Dr. Campbell are to be excluded going forward.
	
Is preparing a formal, forensics-style complaint regarding Dr. Nick Ashford and Tony Lopez. Key points involve an unverified PET-CT report (dated 19 Feb 2025 with addendum 12 Apr 2025), unclear lymph node findings (27mm), lack of clinical follow-up, and contradictory or incomplete responses. Supporting evidence includes email chains, WhatsApp conversations, and official report files. Complaint will be comprehensive, referencing metadata, AI involvement, verification standards, and GMC/MHRA governance requirements.
	
Requests that all future complaint documentation relating to the incident involving Dr. Nick Ashford and Tony Lopez should reference only Tony Lopez and his companies (Doctorum Ltd, The Imaging Clinic Ltd, Mount Alvernia PET CT Ltd) and Dr. Nick Ashford. No additional parties should be named in this specific complaint set.
	
Contacted Ramsay Health Head Office directly on 11 July 2025 at 10:26 (5-minute call to 020 7847 2850) to follow up on their unresolved Stage 2 complaint. The call was logged, and a callback was requested by the end of the day. This interaction is to be noted in the formal complaint timeline and records.
	
Contacted Ramsay Health Care UK Head Office by phone on 11 July 2025 at 10:26 (5-minute call to 020 7847 2850) to follow up on their unresolved Stage 2 complaint. Call was logged, and a callback was requested by end of day.

Is preparing a survival gear and body armour loadout for a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children), with the adults carrying all critical gear and supplies.
	
Has provided the full Oaks Hospital complaint trail, including Stage 1 and Stage 2 correspondence, discharge communication from Mr. Pillai, and additional email chains documenting an uninvestigated spinal lump. These documents are now incorporated into the full legal complaint record.
	
Clarified the following regarding their Stage 2 complaint to Ramsay Health Care UK:

- Point 6: User believes key details regarding the discharge process and follow-up communication were missed and not adequately addressed in the Stage 1 response.
- Point 5: The groin node of concern is on the right side, and user strongly questions whether it was incorrectly identified as a femoral artery without confirmation. This concern is central to their complaint.
- Point 4: No changes needed — user is satisfied with the drafting of this point.
- Point 3: User notes that the ultrasound report did not explicitly reference a right groin lymph node, which is why they are challenging the assumption that the structure seen is a femoral artery without adequate diagnostic confirmation (e.g., Doppler).
- Point 2: User is satisfied with how this point has been drafted.
- Point 1: User would like this billing concern to be removed from the escalation as it is no longer a primary concern.
	
Clarified that their ultrasound scan report (dated February 2025) includes the following findings: right groin was imaged at their request; an 8 mm right inguinal node was noted with preserved fatty hilum; right femoral artery and vein patent; no hernia. Also confirms left kidney measures 14.4 cm with a possible duplex system, and post-void bladder residual of 60 mL. The scan was conducted at Oaks Hospital and reported by Dr. Arun Sebastian.
	
Provided all six pages of the 9 July 2025 complaint response letter from Oaks Hospital, authored by Nick Ratcliffe (Hospital Director), regarding complaints involving Mr. Rajiv Pillai and Dr. Arun Sebastian. User is now reviewing the letter in detail and requesting corrections or rebuttals for factual or clinical inaccuracies.
	
Clarified that their complaint against Ramsay Health Care and Dr. ViJoy Chowdhury was submitted in 2025, not 2024.
	
Has requested that all documentation and evidence creation processes follow the highest professional and legal standards, ensuring that no requirements or details are missed. All future documents must be structured to meet legal admissibility, with full attention to formatting, clarity, and evidential integrity.

They are planning to retrofit a larger Android infotainment screen (10.25" or 12.3") and inquired about replacing the instrument cluster with a digital dash. After thorough analysis, it was confirmed that the head-unit screen upgrade is feasible via plug-and-play kits (with LVDS and CAN integration), while replacing the analog instrument cluster with a digital version is not practical without major custom work. The vehicle VIN is WAUZZZ8P8CA086494.
	
Requests that all document summaries be strictly factual and based solely on content directly present in the files. No inferences, summaries, or clinical assumptions should be made unless explicitly supported by the document text. Mistakes in quoting or interpreting evidence must be avoided in all future outputs.

Received a formal Stage 2 complaint acknowledgment from Nick Ratcliffe (Hospital Director, Oaks Hospital) dated 6 June 2025, in response to a complaint submitted on 12 May 2025. The complaint involved billing transparency, ultrasound protocol deficiencies, contradictory radiology findings, and communication failures involving Mr. Rajiv Pillai and Dr. Arun Sebastian. The letter acknowledges the £1,200 ultrasound overcharge and confirms an internal review has been conducted. The reply also includes a mistaken reference to 'daughter,' which the user has flagged as unprofessional. Gaynor Leader (Head of Operations) and Lauren Radley (Patient Experience) are named as points of contact.
	
Has provided the full 3-page Stage 2 complaint response from Oaks Hospital dated 6 June 2025, signed by Nick Ratcliffe and Gaynor Leader. The letter addresses billing issues, ultrasound protocol concerns, and disputes over the PET-CT findings (including a 28mm lymph node and groin vascular assessment). The hospital response denies visibility of the 28mm node, claims proper imaging was done, and omits several concerns raised by the user. These include the presence of a secretary during a physical exam, dismissal of ADHD/anxious personality references, and failure to follow up on a duplex kidney. The user has requested this analysis and rebuttal be saved.
	
Clarified that Dr. ViJoy Chowdhury is associated with Springfield Hospital, while all events and concerns relating to Oaks Hospital involve other clinicians, such as Mr. Rajiv Pillai and Dr. Arun Sebastian.
	
User’s ultrasound scan on 14 February 2025 at Oaks Hospital (covering renal tract, groin, and testes) was flagged as a 'Clinical Emergency' in the PACS/IEP system. The transfer was logged under transaction ID ROHC062758 with priority listed as 'Clinical Emergency' and package collected on 25 April 2025 by Miss Poppy Camfield. This designation reinforces the urgency of the case and contradicts later downplaying of findings or dismissive interpretations in Ramsay complaint responses.
	
Is planning to taper off Sertraline after 4 years of use, currently at 100mg/day, and is seeking support strategies to manage withdrawal symptoms. User is concurrently taking 70mg Elvanse, 200mg Lamotrigine, Telmisartan, and TRT (testosterone enanthate at 300mg/week), along with an extensive supplement stack. User has requested a personalized tapering protocol and support schedule, including supplement timing, symptom tracking, and a future Methylene Blue introduction plan.
	
Has requested to complete a Personal Independence Payment (PIP) evidence support pack based on their confirmed diagnoses: Bipolar Disorder (Type 2), ADHD (combined type), Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and ongoing unresolved physical health concerns (lymphatic, renal, musculoskeletal, diagnostic delays). User is providing detailed evidence relating to ADHD (70mg Elvanse), Bipolar Disorder (200mg Lamotrigine), Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and other ongoing health conditions. User’s partner helps where possible. All evidence is being tailored to reflect real-life impact and presented in a first-person, accessible format.
	
Confirmed that Sandra Coxell is involved in management at Green Elms Health Centre and is seeking to escalate concerns to higher-level individuals who may operate across other local GP practices. User is actively trying to avoid further dealings with Green Elms.
	
Springfield Hospital provided multiple formal complaint responses, including a 2-page radiology explanation letter from Dr. ViJoy Chowdhury dated 15 May 2025, and a multi-page complaint resolution letter from Nick Jackson dated 16 May 2025. These letters reference failures in PET-CT second opinion reporting, contradictions over lymph node measurements (7 mm vs 27 mm), lack of proper radiologist verification, and procedural delays. Dr. Chowdhury admitted he cannot formally report PET-CT scans and offered a refund.
	
Confirmed that the six images uploaded prior to the 15 May 2025 and 16 May 2025 Springfield Hospital letters are all related to the Springfield Hospital complaint. These include documents authored by Dr. ViJoy Chowdhury and Nick Jackson, covering the PET-CT second opinion dispute, procedural failings, and formal complaint handling responses. All are to be logged under Springfield and retained in memory for full case integration.
	
Was not referred to Ramsay Health Care by any other provider; they attended of their own accord, so Ramsay is not linked via referral pathways.
	
Provided screenshots of the PET-CT scan DICOM viewer interface, confirming that the scan data includes complete multi-planar reconstructions (axial, coronal, sagittal), fused PET-CT images, attenuation-corrected and non-corrected PET datasets, and a high-resolution MIP series. These images confirm the DICOM data sent to Dr. Adela Cristina Suciu was comprehensive and of diagnostic standard.
	
Received an update from the General Medical Council (GMC) confirming that their complaint is under review by a senior member of the enquiries team. The GMC will not share information with Dr. Tony Lopez without prior consent and expects to provide an update within 3–4 weeks.
	
Has requested a formal complaint be drafted for the Care Quality Commission (CQC), detailing systemic failings, complaint mishandling, and governance concerns involving Ramsay Health Care UK, specifically Springfield Hospital (Chelmsford), Mr. Rajiv Pillai, Dr. ViJoy Chowdhury, and broader Ramsay complaints leadership. The complaint should be factually accurate, fully evidenced, and align with all prior correspondence, ISCAS escalation, and GMC involvement (re: Dr. Tony Lopez).
	
Spoke directly with Nick Jackson on 28 May 2025. Jackson confirmed he is still the Hospital Director at Springfield Hospital, but was unfamiliar with the user's complaint and deferred to Dr. Chowdhury for a response, stating he would follow up within a week.
	
Received written confirmation that both Nick Jackson and Vanessa Childs are Hospital Directors within Ramsay Health Care, overseeing hospitals in the South and East.
	
Is developing a high-performance hybrid supplement combining probiotics, amino acids, vitamins, creatine, prebiotics, and electrolytes for fitness and gut health support.
	
Reminder set: Follow up with ASA (Complaint Ref: A25-1291191) if no formal investigation update or outcome is received by early June 2025. All evidence, quotes, and live links were submitted by the user in mid-May, satisfying ASA's request. Awaiting formal review decision or ruling.
	
Received confirmation from Paula Barratt that their Springfield Hospital complaint is being treated as Stage 1. In response, the user sent a clarification email on 14 May 2025, explaining that their original Stage 1 complaint was submitted on 23 April 2025 to Dr. Chowdhury’s secretary, acknowledged at the time, and received no formal resolution. The user requested this now be treated as a Stage 2 investigation per Ramsay’s policy and ISCAS guidelines. This action is now logged.
	
On 17 May 2025, user instructed to notify ISCAS of Springfield Hospital's procedural failure. A formal email was sent outlining the complaint timeline: Stage 1 submitted to Dr. Chowdhury’s secretary on 23 April 2025 (acknowledged), no resolution received, and Stage 2 submitted to Paula Barratt on 9 May. Paula attempted to reclassify the complaint as Stage 1, prompting the user to request ISCAS oversight. ISCAS has been formally contacted for guidance and intervention.
	
Wants the ISCAS escalation email to include mention of the error in Nick Ratcliffe's formal response letter (Oaks Hospital) where he referred incorrectly to 'your daughter,' highlighting template-based or inattentive correspondence.
	
Received a formal Stage 2 acknowledgement letter from Nick Ratcliffe (Oaks Hospital Director, Ramsay Health Care UK) dated 13 May 2025. The letter mistakenly referred to 'your daughter' despite the user being the sole complainant, which will be logged and included in the ISCAS escalation summary as evidence of inattentive or template-based complaint handling.
	
Tony Lopez is not affiliated with Ramsay Health Care UK. His businesses — including The Imaging Clinic Ltd, Doctorum Ltd, and Mount Alvernia PET CT Ltd — operate independently and are not under the Ramsay network. All ASA-related complaints concerning misleading advertising or ownership transparency relate solely to Tony Lopez’s private enterprises, not Ramsay Health. Update all future ASA correspondence and logs accordingly.
	
Correction: Mr. Rajiv Pillai was only seen at Oaks Hospital, not Springfield. All consultations with him occurred at Oaks. The Springfield complaint relates to Dr. ViJoy Chowdhury only. Complaints to each site (Oaks and Springfield) are being handled independently under Ramsay Health Care UK’s complaints procedure.
	
Reminder set: Follow up with Nigel Farage’s constituency office if no reply to formal case submission is received by 22 May 2025. User re-sent full complaint and included full postal address and DOB, meeting MP casework requirements. Awaiting formal response.
	
Mr. Rajiv Pillai is based at Oaks Hospital (Ramsay Health Care UK).
	
Has reviewed and would like to reference the Ramsay Health Care Global Code of Conduct (2023) in their complaints. Key points to cite include: failure to uphold respect and communication standards (Section 1.1), failure to respond to complaints (Section 2.3 & 3.1), potential conflicts of interest (Section 3.4), and lack of clinical follow-up compromising patient safety (Section 4.1). User may use this to support Stage 2 escalation and any ISCAS or regulatory submissions.
	
Has sent a formal complaint to Ramsay Health Care UK via head office email: ramsay.headoffice@ramsayhealth.co.uk.
	
Has submitted Stage 1 and Stage 2 complaints to Springfield Hospital (regarding Dr. ViJoy Chowdhury) and Ramsay Health Head Office (regarding Oaks Hospital, billing issues, and governance failures), and has contacted ISCAS with attached documentation to confirm staging compliance. Awaiting ISCAS confirmation before progressing to Stage 3.
	
Has successfully submitted a formal complaint to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) regarding Mount Alvernia PET CT Ltd and Circle Health Group (Reference No. 505738). Complaint submitted 8 May 2025 and logged concerns include: unverified PET-CT reporting, missing diagnostic records, communication failures, unresolved complaints, and governance risks involving Dr. Tony Lopez. Awaiting CQC response within 5 working days.
	
Has raised formal complaints with Ramsay Health Care UK corporate office, as well as directly with Springfield Hospital and Oaks Hospital, but has received no response to date.
	
Mr. Ward was a self-pay patient from the outset and did not authorize Aviva to be billed for any private consultations or scans. Mr. Pillai’s office incorrectly attempted to bill Aviva.
	
The PET-CT DICOM metadata included a follow-up request labeled for 'lymphoma restaging/follow-up (response to therapy)' entered by Dr. Gavin Campbell, causing concern. Mr. Ward raised this with his GP for clarification but received no response.
	
Dr. Gavin Campbell works closely with both Dr. Pillai and Dr. Chowdhury, raising concerns over impartiality and difficulties encountered in consultations.
	
Dr. Melanie Carter (13 Nov 2024) noted that a 1997 ultrasound showed two normal kidneys, contradicting later duplex kidney findings and adding further concern.
	
Tony Lopez is affiliated with and shares financial/governance roles in Doctorum Ltd, The Imaging Clinic Ltd, and Mount Alvernia PET CT Ltd, impacting data handling and financial transparency.
	
The PET-CT report stated 'Verified by Dr. Nick Ashford,' but metadata confirmed the verification flag was 'unverified,' and oncology completion flags were 'complete' — indicating procedural conflict.
	
Mr. Ward was not satisfied following the PET-CT; Dr. Ashford made an inappropriate comment ('at least you don’t have lymphoma'), which Mr. Ward found dismissive.
	
During his 3 March 2025 consultation, Dr. Chowdhury agreed to arrange a full second opinion on both of Mr. Ward’s PET-CT scans, due to concerns over AI use, unverified reporting, missed FDG uptake, and extravasation. He acknowledged his close friendship with Dr. Gavin Campbell.
	
On 31 March 2025, Dr. Chowdhury did not review the bloods or shoulder X-rays Mr. Ward sent. He also failed to deliver the promised official, legally signed second-opinion radiology report. Instead, he referenced a verbal conversation with an unnamed radiologist and refused to disclose their identity.
	
The £200 fee was charged for a second consultation under the expectation of receiving a legally binding diagnostic report, which Mr. Ward never received. No report was ever sent to his GP.
	
The 9 April 2025 letter by Dr. Chowdhury was not a diagnostic report, but a general summary of his own beliefs based on an informal conversation with an unnamed radiologist.
	
The section about Dr. Chowdhury's defensive email reply and the GMC complaint reference should not be included in the final solicitor timeline.
	
The PET-CT scan report did not explicitly state 'extravasation at injection site' — this was identified by the user independently upon reviewing the scan images and metadata.
	
The PET-CT follow-up request code for 'lymphoma restaging/follow-up (response to therapy)' entered by Dr. Gavin Campbell was related to the 2024 NHS PET-CT scan, not the private 2025 scan. This code caused concern, and the user asked their GP for clarification but received no response.
	
Found a dismissive remark made by Dr. Tony Lopez — 'At least you don’t have lymphoma,' followed by laughter — to be inappropriate. This contributed to the user's belief that the scan was not properly interpreted.
	
Clarified that the date listed as 'Late 2022' for the initial private consultation with Mr. Rajiv Pillai is incorrect.
	
Clarified that the statement suggesting Mr. Pillai arranged a PET-CT referral via NHS in early–mid 2023 is incorrect. Mr. Ward did not undergo private care or referral through Mr. Pillai in that timeframe.
	
Clarified and confirmed the following factual corrections and emphasis points for inclusion in the final solicitor report: 
- The £252 charge for the 06/02/2025 consultation with Mr. Rajiv Pillai was incorrectly billed to Aviva without permission. Mr. Ward was a self-pay patient from the outset and explicitly declined insurance involvement.
- Mr. Ward's DICOM files from the 2024 NHS PET-CT scan showed a follow-up request code: "lymphoma restaging/follow-up (response to therapy)", entered by Dr. Gavin Campbell, which caused confusion and concern. Mr. Ward requested clarification from his GP and received no response.
- Mr. Ward later discovered that Dr. Gavin Campbell worked closely with Dr. Pillai and Dr. Chowdhury, which he believes may explain the difficulty obtaining objective or transparent assessments.
- Dr. Melanie Carter (13 Nov 2024) referenced a 1997 ultrasound showing two normal kidneys, contradicting the 2024–2025 duplex kidney findings and raising further concern.
- Tony Lopez’s affiliations must be clearly stated in the final version: Director or owner of Doctorum Ltd, The Imaging Clinic Ltd, and Mount Alvernia PET CT Ltd — raising shared data governance and financial conflicts of interest.
- The statement "Verified by Dr. Nick Ashford" dated 20 Feb 2025 is contradicted by metadata: onco flags marked 'complete' but the verification flag was 'unverified'. The same is reflected in the radiology report metadata.
- The phrase "Patient Satisfaction" (22/02/2025) should be removed. Mr. Ward was not satisfied, and Dr. Lopez’s laughing comment ("at least you don’t have lymphoma") was inappropriate and dismissive.
- 3 Mar 2025 – Dr. Chowdhury consultation:
  - Stated he would get a full second opinion on both PET-CT scans
  - Acknowledged close friendship with Dr. Gavin Campbell
  - Promised a formal, signed radiological second opinion report due to concerns about AI use, unverified reporting, FDG uptake not documented, and extravasation
- 31 Mar 2025 – Second consultation with Dr. Chowdhury:
  - Did not review blood tests or shoulder X-rays Mr. Ward sent
  - Did not provide the promised official diagnostic report
  - Offered only an informal conversation with an unnamed radiologist, refused to share their name or allow questions
  - Contradicted Dr. Ashford's documented 27 mm node with no imaging or report to support that claim
  - The £200 charge was for this consultation, which was supposed to result in a formal, legally binding report. No such report was sent to the GP.
- 9 Apr 2025 – Dr. Chowdhury’s letter to the GP was not a diagnostic report, but a general summary of personal opinion and conversation with an unnamed radiologist. It does not meet criteria for inclusion in records as a second-opinion diagnostic conclusion.
- The email reply from Dr. Chowdhury around 14–15 Apr 2025 and any mention of a GMC complaint should be excluded from the final version, per user instruction.
- The forensic summaries Mr. Ward prepared documented:
  - PET-CT unverified status
  - Contradictions between statements from Dr. Pillai and Dr. Chowdhury
  - Dismissal of the 27 mm node despite legal documentation
  - Absence of a formal report from the 2024 NHS PET-CT, representing a record-keeping failure
  - PET-CT being described as “whole-body” despite being skull-to-thigh only.

Requests a complete re-evaluation of the entire ultrasound image series provided (Series-001), using all available knowledge and interpretation skill, but without relying on or referencing prior reports. The new report should be independent, unbiased, and constructed as though the images are being reviewed for the first time.
	
Requests a complete re-analysis of the ultrasound image set from Series-001, reviewing one image at a time in sequence. Each frame should be interpreted independently and objectively, using no prior reports or assumptions, to construct a fresh and unbiased comprehensive diagnostic-style report.
	
Has requested a full reset and line-by-line re-verification of their entire forensic casefile bundle to ensure all statements, findings, and timelines are fully accurate and supported by evidence. All previous summaries will be re-reviewed with a fresh factual audit.
	
Has identified a biased clinical statement in their referral letter: 'He is quite an anxious personality and has got a history of ADHD.' This has been formally logged as a governance concern and will be included in the next GMC/ISCAS complaint submission as an example of subjective bias and improper record-keeping.
	
Requests that all amendments based on new cross-referenced images be directly saved into the live version of their updated forensic report going forward. All edits should be preserved cumulatively.
	
Has provided further documentary evidence confirming: a 27–28 mm FDG-avid groin node was observed in imaging but falsely dismissed as 'error' or 'non-significant' by Dr. Chowdhury, and inaccurately referred to as part of a 'negative PET scan' by Mr. Rajiv Pillai; two consultations with Dr. Chowdhury (totaling £500) were billed without a radiology reinterpretation being issued, despite the user raising concerns about missed findings; multiple invoices and receipts confirm charges from both Chowdhury and Pillai, including an insurance shortfall and personal payments; a 14 Feb 2025 ultrasound confirmed both an enlarged groin node and a 14.4 cm duplex kidney—neither of which were acted on clinically; documentation includes cost breakdowns, email chains, and invoices, forming the basis for new exhibits and governance complaints regarding financial transparency and clinical dismissal.
	
Has now provided final evidence from the February 2025 PET-CT reports confirming: a 27 mm groin lymph node was explicitly described in the report by Dr. Nick Ashford (SUVmax 1.1), contradicting both Mr. Rajiv Pillai’s “negative PET scan” claim and Dr. ViJoy Chowdhury’s dismissal of the node as a reporting error. The PET-CT was marked “UNVERIFIED” in the metadata and only covered skull-to-thigh (not whole-body). An earlier report from 18 February also noted enlarged groin nodes and suggested biopsy or follow-up PET. This evidence will be included in the formal complaint exhibit log (Exhibit AL), documenting the contradiction, clinical dismissal, and radiological oversight.
	
Has finalized and submitted a solicitor-reviewed document titled “Jamie Ward – Private Healthcare Negligence Complaint Case Bundle (2025),” which includes a cover letter, executive summary, main complaint narrative, regulatory breach analysis, and 9 appendices of supporting evidence. The bundle documents serious failings across multiple providers (The Imaging Clinic Ltd, Doctorum Ltd, Mount Alvernia PET CT Ltd, Circle Health Group), including diagnostic errors, unverified AI findings, improper PET-CT reporting, billing misconduct, conflict of interest, GDPR violations, and denial of follow-up care. This case has now been formally submitted and is being used as the primary legal and regulatory submission.
	
Has confirmed that the discharge letters and reports issued by Mr. Rajiv Pillai (private urology consultant, Oaks Hospital) are to be retained as legally binding evidence for future complaint or legal escalation. These documents include contradictory discharge reasoning, dismissal of a growing groin lump, failure to investigate a possible duplex/enlarged kidney (14.4 cm), and post-micturition bladder volume of 60 mL. Multiple versions of the discharge letter exist. All findings and contradictions are saved for future action (e.g., formal GMC complaint, Ramsay Health complaint, or legal referral).
	
Confirmed NHS findings include: right shoulder ultrasound (Dec 2024) showing low-grade subacromial impingement and AC joint degeneration, matching PET-CT FDG uptake; left kidney ultrasound (Nov 2024) showing an enlarged kidney with a possible duplex system, which was never followed up; groin ultrasound (July 2024) showing bilateral reactive lymphadenopathy (<10mm), later contradicted by PET-CT showing a 27mm node; testicular ultrasound (Feb 2023) showing normal testes and small benign epididymal cysts.
	
Had a private PET-CT in Feb 2025 that found a 27mm groin node, extravasation, and a pubic lesion.
	
NHS records reflect persistent lymphadenopathy coded as active since 31 May 2024.
	
GP records from Feb 2025 confirm internal record edits (ADHD, SCR preferences) during clerical cleanup.
	
Requests a full, word-for-word re-review of all uploaded medical files to ensure no results, findings, or commentary are missed. Prioritization of thoroughness over speed confirmed.
	
Ultrasound from 14 Feb 2025 (Dr Arun Sebastian, Oaks Hospital) confirms: normal testes and epididymides, but minor free fluid around right testis noted. Left kidney measures 14.4 cm with possible duplex system (cortical bridge); confirmed again as an independent duplex concern. Bladder showed 60 mL residual urine post-void. Groin node 8 mm, structurally benign. Patient specifically requested SI/groin scan due to persistent symptoms; SI oedema noted. No sinister pathology reported.
	
A 14 Feb 2025 ultrasound reconfirmed a duplex kidney independently and noted free fluid around the right testis and a 60 mL bladder residual.
	
A Nov 2024 NHS abdominal ultrasound confirmed the left kidney was enlarged (14.1 cm) and possibly duplex, but no follow-up imaging was arranged.
	
A 26 Jul 2024 groin ultrasound showed all lymph nodes were under 10 mm and reactive, which directly conflicts with a PET-CT finding of a 27 mm node.
	
Private PET-CT documents and correspondence confirm: report marked as UNVERIFIED in DICOM metadata; no SUV correction or delayed imaging performed despite visible extravasation; PET-CT labelled as whole-body but covered only skull-to-thigh; multiple contradictions in reporting from Dr. Ashford; no radiologist verification or PACS signature present in metadata; correspondence confirms Dr. Ashford could not explain or resolve missing verification. All communications now part of Exhibit AM.
	
Is building a chronological and categorized master documentation log of all medical files, emails, reports, and communications, including tracking inconsistencies, errors, omissions, and procedural concerns. They have uploaded a wide range of files and are reviewing each one to extract findings into a comprehensive record.
