## Superhuman Terminal Help

The AI-powered terminal includes built-in help:

```bash
# Start the terminal
python superhuman_terminal.py

# Try these commands in the terminal:
help
status
list files
show README.md
```

### Common Terminal Commands
- `help` - Show available commands and usage
- `status` - Display system status and configuration

- `show <file>` - Display file contents
- `run <script>` - Execute scripts safely
- `search <term>` - Find files or content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### spaCy Model Not Found
```bash
# Download the required model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

#### Import Errors
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Check for missing packages
python -c "import ai_tools; print('Import successful')"
```

#### Permission Errors
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x shell_scripts/*.sh

# Check file permissions
ls -la python_scripts/
```

#### CI/CD Failures
- Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions
- Verify all tests pass locally
- Ensure dependencies are up to date
- Review code quality checks

### System Requirements
