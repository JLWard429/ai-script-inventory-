# Documentation Generation for AI Orchestra

I'm building an AI Orchestra system for medical investigations, and I need comprehensive documentation for users and developers.

## Core Requirements
Create complete documentation including:
1. User guide explaining the system capabilities
2. Developer documentation for extending the system
3. API reference for all core classes and methods
4. Example usage scenarios for medical investigation cases
5. Command-line interface documentation

## Technical Requirements
- Markdown format
- Clear structure with proper headings
- Code examples for key functionality
- Screenshots or diagrams where helpful (describe what they should show)
- Troubleshooting section

## Special Focus Areas
- Medical document analysis capabilities
- Timeline generation and visualization
- Contradiction detection and validation
- Email integration and document linking

Return only the documentation in Markdown format - no explanations or commentary outside the documentation itself.
