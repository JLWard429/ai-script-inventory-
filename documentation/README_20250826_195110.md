# AI Script Inventory

This repository contains a collection of AI-related scripts and tools with automated workflow management.

## ðŸš€ Superhuman AI Workflow System

This repository implements an advanced automation system for managing AI scripts, ensuring code quality, and maintaining documentation.

### Key Features

- **Automated Code Organization**: Files are automatically sorted by type into appropriate directories
- **Code Quality Assurance**: Automated linting, formatting, and security scanning
- **Documentation Management**: Auto-generated and maintained documentation
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suite with coverage reporting
- **Security Monitoring**: Automated vulnerability scanning and dependency checks

### Directory Structure

- `python_scripts/` - Python scripts and AI tools
- `shell_scripts/` - Shell scripts and command-line utilities
- `docs/` - Documentation, guides, and reference materials
- `text_files/` - Configuration files, logs, and text-based resources
- `.github/` - GitHub Actions workflows and automation scripts

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install development dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
3. Set up pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`
4. Start contributing! The automation will handle organization and quality checks.

## ðŸ“‹ Best Practices

### Module Naming Guidelines

To prevent import conflicts and maintain code clarity:

- **Avoid shadowing standard library modules**: Never name local modules the same as Python standard library modules (e.g., `types`, `os`, `sys`, `json`, etc.)
- **Use descriptive names**: If you need a local types module, name it something specific like `types_mod`, `custom_types`, or `<domain>_types`
- **Be consistent**: Once you choose a naming convention, use it consistently throughout the project
- **Check before naming**: Before creating a new module, verify the name doesn't conflict with stdlib: `python -c "import <name>"`

### Import Guidelines

- **Prefer explicit imports**: Use `from module import SpecificClass` over `import module`
- **Use aliases for clarity**: If you must import both stdlib and local modules, use aliases: `import types as stdlib_types, types_mod as local_types`
- **Check import resolution**: Test that your imports work as expected in different environments

### Why This Matters

Standard library shadowing can cause:
- Import errors in different environments
- Unexpected behavior when stdlib functions are masked
- Debugging difficulties
- Maintenance problems as the codebase grows
