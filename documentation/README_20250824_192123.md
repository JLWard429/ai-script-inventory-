This repository contains a curated collection of AI-related scripts and tools, enhanced with a **superhuman AI workflow system** that automates code organization, quality assurance, security scanning, and documentation management.

## ✨ What Makes This "Superhuman"?

Our workflow system performs tasks more consistently and thoroughly than manual processes:

- 🔄 **Automated Organization**: Files are intelligently sorted and organized
- 🛡️ **Security-First**: Every commit is scanned for vulnerabilities
- 📊 **Quality Assurance**: Multi-layer code quality checks and formatting
- 📚 **Self-Documenting**: Documentation updates automatically with code changes
- 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing**: Multi-version testing with coverage tracking
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized**: Efficient workflows with smart caching and parallelization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Users

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JLWard429/ai-script-inventory-.git
cd ai-script-inventory-

# Install development tools (optional, for contributing)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up pre-commit hooks (for contributors)
pre-commit install
```

### For Contributors

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push

# The superhuman workflow automatically:
# ✅ Formats your code
# ✅ Runs security scans
# ✅ Organizes files by type
# ✅ Updates documentation
# ✅ Runs comprehensive tests
# ✅ Provides detailed feedback
```

## 🛠️ Key Components

### 🤖 Automated File Organization

Files are automatically organized by type using intelligent detection:

- `.py` files → `python_scripts/`
- `.md` files → `docs/`
- `.sh` files → `shell_scripts/`
- `.txt`, `.json`, `.yaml` → `text_files/`

### 🔍 Code Quality Pipeline

**Multi-layer quality assurance:**

- **Formatting**: Black (Python), Prettier (JSON/YAML)
- **Linting**: flake8, mypy for type checking
- **Security**: Bandit for vulnerability scanning
- **Dependencies**: Safety for known vulnerabilities
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting

### 🛡️ Security Features

- Automated vulnerability scanning on every commit
- Dependency security monitoring
- Pre-commit security hooks
- Secrets detection and prevention

### 📊 Monitoring & Reporting

- Comprehensive workflow summaries
- Code coverage tracking
- Security vulnerability reports
- Performance metrics and optimization

## 🚦 Workflow Status

The repository runs three main automated workflows:

1. **🔧 Code Quality & Security** - Runs on every push/PR
2. **🚀 CI/CD Pipeline** - Comprehensive testing and validation
3. **📁 Auto Organization** - Keeps repository structure clean
