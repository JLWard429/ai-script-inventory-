# Contradiction Detector Module Development

I'm building an AI Orchestra system for medical investigations. I need you to create a sophisticated contradiction detection module.

## Core Requirements
Create a comprehensive contradiction detector that can:
1. Compare statements across multiple documents
2. Identify numeric inconsistencies (e.g., 7mm vs 27mm measurements)
3. Detect logical contradictions in medical findings
4. Identify temporal inconsistencies in event sequences
5. Flag potential documentation errors or deliberate misstatements

## Technical Requirements
- Pure Python implementation
- Proper error handling and logging
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Type annotations
- Unit tests for core functionality

## Special Focus Areas
- Medical measurement contradictions (particularly lymph node sizes)
- Procedural inconsistencies in complaint handling
- Diagnostic conclusion discrepancies
- Treatment recommendation conflicts

Return only Python code in a properly formatted module structure with no explanations - just production-ready code that handles complex contradiction detection in medical documents.
