# Test Suite Development for AI Orchestra

I'm building an AI Orchestra system for medical investigations. GitHub Copilot has created our core framework, and I need you to develop comprehensive test cases.

## Core Requirements
Create a complete test suite that validates:
1. Database initialization and integrity
2. Document processing and storage
3. Timeline generation accuracy
4. Contradiction detection functionality
5. Edge case handling

## Technical Requirements
- Use pytest framework
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Create appropriate fixtures and mocks
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure >90% code coverage

## Test Data
Create synthetic test data that simulates:
- Medical reports with measurements
- Emails with references to reports
- Documents with deliberate contradictions
- Timeline events with various entity relationships

Return only Python test code with no explanations - just production-ready pytest modules with comprehensive test coverage.
