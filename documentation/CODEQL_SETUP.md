- **SARIF Integration**: Full integration with GitHub Security tab

### Automated Workflows
- **Multiple Triggers**: Push, PR, scheduled scans, manual dispatch for Python files
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Monday/Thursday morning scans + Friday evening comprehensive Python analysis
- **Branch Protection**: Scans feature branches, hotfix branches, and main branches for Python code
- **Smart Path Triggers**: Only runs when Python files or configuration files change

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Files

### Main Workflow: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
The primary CodeQL workflow file with:
- Python-focused security analysis
- Optimized build configuration for Python projects
- Comprehensive reporting and artifact generation

### Configuration: `.github/codeql-config.yml`
Advanced CodeQL configuration including:
- Custom query suites and filters
- Path inclusion/exclusion rules
- Build environment configuration
- Performance optimization settings
- Feature flags for experimental capabilities

## üöÄ Usage

### Automatic Scans
The system runs automatically on:
- **Push events** to main, develop, feature, and hotfix branches
- **Pull requests** to main and develop branches
- **Scheduled scans** (Monday/Thursday 6 AM UTC, Friday 6 PM UTC)

### Manual Scans
Trigger manual scans with custom options:
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Professional CodeQL Python Security Analysis
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Configure options:
   - **Scan Level**: quick, comprehensive, or extended
   - **Languages**: Python (default and only supported language)
   - **Upload Database**: Enable/disable database upload

### Viewing Results
- **Security Tab**: Main results in repository Security ‚Üí Code scanning
- **Workflow Artifacts**: Detailed reports downloadable from workflow runs
- **Step Summary**: Quick overview in workflow run summary

## üîç Analysis Coverage

### Security Analysis
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Path traversal attacks
- Command injection
- Cryptographic issues
- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Input validation problems

### Code Quality
- Dead code detection
- Unused variables and imports
- Code complexity analysis
- Performance anti-patterns
- Memory leak detection
- Thread safety issues

### Best Practices
- Coding standard violations
- Documentation gaps
- Error handling patterns
- Resource management
- API usage patterns

## üîß Customization

### Adding Custom Queries
1. Create custom queries in `.github/codeql-queries/`
2. Reference them in `.github/codeql-config.yml`
3. Test with manual workflow dispatch

### Language-Specific Configuration
The workflow is optimized specifically for Python with custom build steps and environment settings. The configuration includes:
- Python dependency management
- Virtual environment handling
- Security analysis tool integration (Bandit, Safety)
- Advanced Python-specific CodeQL queries

### Performance Tuning
Adjust these settings in `.github/codeql-config.yml`:
- `ram`: Memory allocation (default: 14000MB)
- `threads`: CPU threads (default: 0 = all available)
- `timeout`: Analysis timeout (default: 120 minutes)

## üìä Monitoring and Alerts

### Workflow Status
- Monitor workflow runs in the Actions tab
- Check for failed analyses and build issues
- Review performance metrics and runtime

### Security Alerts
- GitHub Security tab shows all findings
- Configure notifications for new security alerts
- Set up automated issue creation for critical findings

### Reporting
- Weekly security reports generated as artifacts
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline
- SARIF files uploaded for external tool integration

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Workflows

This CodeQL setup integrates seamlessly with existing repository workflows:
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Runs alongside existing quality checks
- **Dependency Scanning**: Complements existing dependency security scans
- **Code Quality**: Works with existing linting and formatting tools

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Repository Setup
1. ‚úÖ Enable GitHub Advanced Security (for private repos)
2. ‚úÖ Configure branch protection rules
3. ‚úÖ Enable secret scanning
4. ‚úÖ Set up Dependabot alerts

### Workflow Security
1. ‚úÖ Minimal required permissions
2. ‚úÖ Secure artifact handling
3. ‚úÖ No secrets in workflow files
4. ‚úÖ Path-based trigger filtering

### Response Process
1. **High/Critical**: Address within 24 hours
2. **Medium**: Address within 1 week
3. **Low**: Address during next sprint
4. **False Positives**: Document and suppress with justification
