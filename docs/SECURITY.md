  bandit:
    - Skip: [B101]  # Skip assert_used test
    - Severity: medium
    - Confidence: high
  
  safety:
    - Check: dependencies
    - Database: updated_daily

```

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### ‚úÖ Secure Coding Practices

**Python:**
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Use environment variables for secrets
import os
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("API_KEY environment variable required")

# ‚úÖ Good: Input validation
def process_user_input(user_input: str) -> str:
    if not isinstance(user_input, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string")
    # Sanitize and validate input
    sanitized = user_input.strip()[:100]  # Limit length
    if not sanitized.isalnum():
        raise ValueError("Input contains invalid characters")
    return sanitized

# ‚ùå Bad: Hardcoded secrets
api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"  # Will be caught by automation!

# ‚ùå Bad: SQL injection risk
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # Dangerous!
```

**Shell Scripts:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Input validation
validate_input() {
    local input="$1"
    if [[ ! "$input" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]]; then
        echo "Error: Invalid input format" >&2
        return 1
    fi
}

# ‚úÖ Good: Secure file operations
readonly TEMP_FILE=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$TEMP_FILE"' EXIT

# ‚ùå Bad: Command injection risk
eval "$user_input"  # Extremely dangerous!

# ‚ùå Bad: Insecure temporary files
echo "$data" > /tmp/insecure_file  # Predictable filename!
```

#### üîí Dependency Management

**Requirements:**
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use specific version pinning
- Review new dependencies for security issues
- Prefer well-maintained packages

```python
# pyproject.toml - Good dependency specification
[project]
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.31.0,<3.0.0",  # Specific, secure version range
    "cryptography>=41.0.0",     # Latest security patches
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "bandit>=1.7.5",           # Security linting
    "safety>=3.0.0",           # Vulnerability scanning
]
```

### For Maintainers

#### üîë Access Control

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Required for all maintainers
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Quarterly permission audits
- **Secure Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets, never commit secrets

#### üìã Security Checklist for Releases

- [ ] All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] Security scans completed with no high/critical issues
- [ ] Code review completed by at least two maintainers
- [ ] Release notes include security improvements
- [ ] Security advisory published if applicable
