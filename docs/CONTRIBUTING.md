## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Scripts

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Brief description of what the script does.

This script demonstrates the coding standards for the AI Script Inventory.
"""

import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List, Optional

def main() -> None:
    """Main function with type hints and docstring."""
    print("Hello, AI World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Requirements:**
- Type hints for function parameters and return values
- Docstrings for modules, classes, and functions
- PEP 8 compliance (enforced automatically)
- Error handling for external dependencies
- Clear variable and function names

### Shell Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Brief description of what the script does
#
# Usage: script_name.sh [options]
# Author: Your Name
# Date: YYYY-MM-DD

set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined vars, pipe failures

main() {
    echo "Hello, Shell World!"
}

# Only run main if script is executed directly
if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]]; then
    main "$@"
fi
```

**Requirements:**
- Proper shebang line
- Error handling with `set -euo pipefail`
- Clear documentation and usage information
- Proper quoting and variable handling
- ShellCheck compliance (checked automatically)

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Follow Markdown best practices
- Add screenshots for UI-related features
- Keep README files up-to-date

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### For Python Scripts

```python
# tests/test_your_script.py
import pytest
from pathlib import Path

def test_script_functionality():
    """Test that your script works as expected."""
    # Arrange
    test_input = "sample data"
    
    # Act
    result = your_function(test_input)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_output

def test_script_error_handling():
    """Test that your script handles errors gracefully."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        your_function(invalid_input)
```

### For Shell Scripts

```bash
# Add to existing test files or create new ones
test_shell_script() {
    # Test successful execution
    ./your_script.sh --help
    assertEquals "Should return help" 0 $?
    
    # Test error handling
    ./your_script.sh --invalid-option
    assertNotEquals "Should fail with invalid option" 0 $?
}
```

### Testing Best Practices

- Write tests before or alongside your code
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Aim for good coverage (automatically tracked)

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### What We Check Automatically

- **Hardcoded secrets** (passwords, API keys, tokens)
- **Known vulnerabilities** in dependencies
- **Insecure coding patterns** (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Suspicious shell commands**
- **File permission issues**

### Security Best Practices

```python
# ✅ Good: Use environment variables for secrets
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("API_KEY environment variable required")

# ❌ Bad: Hardcoded secrets
api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"  # This will be caught by automation!
```

```bash
# ✅ Good: Validate input
if [[ ! "$input" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Error: Invalid input format"
    exit 1
fi

# ❌ Bad: No input validation
eval "$user_input"  # Dangerous! Will be flagged
```

## 📊 Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commit format:

- `feat: add new AI training script`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in data processor`
- `docs: update API documentation`
- `test: add unit tests for utility functions`
- `refactor: improve code organization`
