## Purpose

This guide establishes standardized procedures for file and folder management within the forensic-grade medical investigation infrastructure. All file operations must maintain complete audit trails, preserve data integrity, and ensure legal admissibility of evidence.

---

## File Management Principles

### Core Requirements
1. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every file operation must be logged with full details
2. **Data Integrity**: File checksums must be verified before and after operations
3. **Access Control**: All file access must be authenticated and authorized
4. **Chain of Custody**: Maintain unbroken documentation of file handling
5. **Backup Verification**: Ensure all files are properly backed up before operations
6. **Legal Admissibility**: Maintain standards required for court proceedings

### File Naming Convention
```
[CATEGORY]-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[CASE-ID]-[SEQUENCE]-[VERSION].[EXTENSION]
