FORENSIC-GRADE MEDICAL INVESTIGATION INFRASTRUCTURE
FILE STAGING AND INITIAL TRIAGE INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================

VERSION: 1.0
EFFECTIVE DATE: [DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION]
CLASSIFICATION: MEDICAL/LEGAL INVESTIGATION SUPPORT
RETENTION: PERMANENT

PURPOSE
-------
This document provides standardized procedures for file staging and initial triage
in medical/legal investigations requiring forensic-grade documentation standards.
All procedures must maintain audit trails and ensure regulatory compliance.

STAGING WORKFLOW
----------------

1. INTAKE AND INITIAL ASSESSMENT
   - Assign unique case identifier (format: YYYY-MM-DD-CASE-###)
   - Document receipt timestamp with UTC+local time notation
   - Perform initial file integrity verification (checksums)
   - Log all handling personnel with timestamps

2. CLASSIFICATION AND CATEGORIZATION
   - Medical records: MED-[case-id]-[sequence]
   - Regulatory documents: REG-[case-id]-[sequence]
   - Correspondence: CORR-[case-id]-[sequence]
   - Legal documents: LEGAL-[case-id]-[sequence]
   - Supporting evidence: EVID-[case-id]-[sequence]

3. TRIAGE PRIORITY LEVELS
   Priority 1 (URGENT): Immediate threat to patient safety or regulatory compliance
   Priority 2 (HIGH): Time-sensitive regulatory deadlines or legal requirements
   Priority 3 (STANDARD): Routine investigation materials
   Priority 4 (BACKGROUND): Supporting documentation and reference materials

4. STAGING DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
   /private/care/staging/
   ├── intake/           # Raw files awaiting processing
   ├── processing/       # Files undergoing review and analysis
   ├── verified/         # Files that have passed initial verification
   ├── quarantine/       # Files with potential issues or contamination
   └── archived/         # Completed staging files ready for permanent storage

QUALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------

- DUAL VERIFICATION: All file movements require two-person verification
- CHAIN OF CUSTODY: Complete documentation of all file access and modifications
- INTEGRITY CHECKS: SHA-256 checksums for all files at each stage
- ACCESS LOGGING: Complete audit trail of all personnel access
- BACKUP VERIFICATION: Confirmed backup of all staged materials

TRIAGE CHECKLIST
-----------------
□ Unique case identifier assigned
□ Timestamp recorded (UTC and local)
□ File integrity verified (checksums)
□ Classification assigned
□ Priority level determined
□ Staging directory location documented
□ Chain of custody form initiated
□ Access permissions verified
□ Backup confirmation obtained
□ Master index entry created

ESCALATION PROCEDURES
--------------------
IMMEDIATE ESCALATION REQUIRED for:
- Files containing evidence of patient harm
- Regulatory violations requiring immediate reporting
- Security breaches or unauthorized access
- Data integrity failures or corruption
- Missing required documentation

NOTES
-----
This document is part of a forensic-grade investigation infrastructure.
All procedures must be followed exactly as specified to maintain
legal admissibility and regulatory compliance.

Any deviations from these procedures must be documented in the
FORENSIC_ERROR_LOG.md with justification and approval.
