CRITICAL_ERROR_WEIGHT = 100    # Weight for critical errors affecting patient safety/legal admissibility
HIGH_ERROR_WEIGHT = 50         # Weight for high priority errors requiring urgent attention  
MEDIUM_ERROR_WEIGHT = 20       # Weight for medium priority errors with moderate impact

EVIDENCE_CATEGORY_WEIGHT = 30      # Weight for evidence documents in legal proceedings
MEDICAL_CATEGORY_WEIGHT = 25       # Weight for medical records and clinical documentation
REGULATORY_CATEGORY_WEIGHT = 20    # Weight for regulatory compliance documents

MAXIMUM_PRIORITY_SCORE = 200   # Cap to prevent score overflow and maintain queue balance

def calculate_review_priority(document):
    """
    Calculate priority score for document review queue management.
    
    Args:
        document: Document object with error counts, category, and risk scores
        
    Returns:
        int: Priority score capped at MAXIMUM_PRIORITY_SCORE
    """
    score = 0
    
    # Error severity weighting - critical issues take precedence
    if document.critical_errors > 0:
        score += CRITICAL_ERROR_WEIGHT
    if document.high_errors > 0:
        score += HIGH_ERROR_WEIGHT
    if document.medium_errors > 0:
        score += MEDIUM_ERROR_WEIGHT
    
    # Document importance - legal and medical documents prioritized
    if document.category == "EVIDENCE":
        score += EVIDENCE_CATEGORY_WEIGHT
    elif document.category == "MEDICAL":
        score += MEDICAL_CATEGORY_WEIGHT
    elif document.category == "REGULATORY":
        score += REGULATORY_CATEGORY_WEIGHT
    
    # Additional risk factors
    score += document.compliance_risk_score
    score += document.case_priority_multiplier
    
    # Ensure score doesn't exceed maximum to maintain queue balance
    return min(score, MAXIMUM_PRIORITY_SCORE)
