This repository contains a collection of AI-related scripts and tools with automated workflow management.

## üöÄ Superhuman AI Workflow System

This repository implements an advanced automation system for managing AI scripts, ensuring code quality, and maintaining documentation.

### Key Features

- **Automated Code Organization**: Files are automatically sorted by type into appropriate directories
- **Code Quality Assurance**: Automated linting, formatting, and security scanning
- **Documentation Management**: Auto-generated and maintained documentation
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suite with coverage reporting
- **Security Monitoring**: Automated vulnerability scanning and dependency checks

### Directory Structure

- `python_scripts/` - Python scripts and AI tools
- `shell_scripts/` - Shell scripts and command-line utilities
- `docs/` - Documentation, guides, and reference materials
- `text_files/` - Configuration files, logs, and text-based resources
- `.github/` - GitHub Actions workflows and automation scripts

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install development dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
3. Set up pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`
4. Start contributing! The automation will handle organization and quality checks.

See [WORKFLOW.md](docs/WORKFLOW.md) for detailed information about the automation system.

## üîí Security

Security is a top priority for this project. We implement multiple layers of automated security scanning:

- **Static Analysis**: Bandit security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety vulnerability checks  
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Semantic code analysis
- **Secret Detection**: Automated secret scanning

For security issues, please see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).
