- **Automated Code Organization**: Files are automatically sorted by type into appropriate directories
- **Code Quality Assurance**: Automated linting, formatting, and security scanning
- **Documentation Management**: Auto-generated and maintained documentation
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suite with coverage reporting
- **Security Monitoring**: Automated vulnerability scanning and dependency checks

### Superman CLI

The repository includes a Superman CLI (`superman`) that provides an enhanced AI terminal experience:

**Key Features:**
- **Internet Connectivity Check**: Automatically checks for internet access on startup
- **Offline Mode Support**: Gracefully handles offline scenarios with clear warnings
- **System Status Monitoring**: Checks spaCy installation and OpenAI API configuration
- **Natural Language Processing**: Advanced intent recognition for intuitive commands
- **Memory System**: Persistent conversation context and learning
