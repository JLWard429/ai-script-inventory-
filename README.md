# 🤖 AI Script Inventory

A professional, enterprise-grade repository for organizing and managing AI-related scripts with comprehensive automation, security analysis, and quality controls.

This repository contains a collection of AI-related scripts and features the **Superhuman AI Terminal** — a privacy-friendly, local-only AI terminal interface.

---

## 🚀 Superhuman AI Terminal

The Superhuman AI Terminal provides a natural language interface to interact with your AI script inventory. It uses local intent recognition (no cloud LLMs required) to understand and execute your requests.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Launch the terminal
python terminal.py
# or
python superhuman_terminal.py
```

### Features

- **Natural Language Commands**: Type requests like "run organize_ai_scripts" or "list all Python files"
- **Local Intent Recognition**: All processing happens locally — no cloud dependencies
- **Script Execution**: Run Python and shell scripts with simple commands
- **File Management**: List, search, preview, and summarize files
- **Repository Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing repository structure

### Example Commands

```
🤖 > help                          # Show available commands
🤖 > run test_script.py            # Execute a Python script
🤖 > list all Python files         # List files by type
🤖 > show README.md                # Display file contents
🤖 > summarize CONTRIBUTING.md     # Get a summary of a document
