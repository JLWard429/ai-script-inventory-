  To ensure that Spacy and its dependencies work correctly within your environment, it’s important to verify that all the required packages are installed. Given that Spacy is installed in your virtual   
  environment, its dependencies should typically be installed automatically. Here's how you can handle this:                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                       Steps to Ensure Dependencies:

  It seems you're looking at the metadata for the Spacy package, specifically the "Required-by" field, which would list any packages that depend on Spacy. If this field is empty or not specified, it     
  means there are no other packages in your environment that explicitly list Spacy as a dependency.

      - **Debugging**: If errors occur, check logs or console output for error messages.                                                                                                                   
      - **Verbose Output**: Add print statements or logging to capture the flow and identify where issues arise.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                           
   5. **Optimization and Adjustment**:                                                                                                                                                                     
      - **Refine Prompts**: Ensure prompts fed to OpenAI are clear and well-structured for better responses.                                                                                               
      - **Model Selection**: Experiment with different models and parameters to find the best fit for your task.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                           
   ### Troubleshooting Tips:                                                                                                                                                                               
   - **Network Issues**: Ensure your network connection is stable for API calls.                                                                                                                           
   - **API Limits**: Monitor your usage to avoid hitting OpenAI's rate limits.                                                                                                                             
   - **Error Logs**: Collect and review any error messages from your script execution for deeper insights.
